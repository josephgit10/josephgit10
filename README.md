# Hi, I'm Joseph Thomas ðŸ‘‹  

ðŸŽ“ **Master of Engineering in Robotics** | University of Maryland, College Park (Graduating May 2024)  
ðŸ¤– Passionate about building intelligent systems, leveraging robotics, machine learning, and automation to solve real-world problems.  

## ðŸš€ About Me  
Iâ€™m a robotics engineer with experience in motion planning, computer vision, and system integration. I enjoy working on challenging projects that bridge the gap between cutting-edge algorithms and practical applications in autonomous systems.

## ðŸ’» Technical Expertise  
- **Programming Languages:** Python, C++, MATLAB, SQL  
- **Frameworks & Libraries:** ROS1, ROS2, PyTorch, TensorFlow, OpenCV, Scikit-learn  
- **Tools:** Gazebo, RViz, CoppeliaSim, Docker, Git, SolidWorks, Fusion 360  

## ðŸ”§ Projects  
### **Informed RRT* Trajectory Planning**  
- Implemented an optimized path planning algorithm for autonomous robots using Python and ROS.  
- Designed custom obstacle maps for simulations in Gazebo, achieving faster convergence and efficient navigation.  

### **Vehicle Speed Estimation Using Optical Flow**  
- Built a pipeline combining YOLO and RAFT optical flow for real-time speed estimation.  
- Achieved high accuracy on the KITTI dataset and validated performance using Raspberry Pi hardware.  

### **Hate Speech Detection on Resource-Limited Devices**  
- Optimized BERT-based models (TinyBERT, DistilBERT) to run efficiently on low-resource hardware.  
- Demonstrated strong performance on multiple datasets, improving F1 scores and reducing inference time by up to 37%.  

## ðŸŒŸ Experience  
- **Void Robotics (Intern):** Improved waypoint navigation for TurtleBot3 simulations and resolved testing suite failures.  
- **Defense Research and Development Organization (DRDO, Intern):** Designed and prototyped a remote-controlled weapon mount system, demonstrating proficiency in CAD and mechatronics.

## ðŸŽ¸ Beyond Robotics  
When I'm not working on robotics projects, youâ€™ll likely find me playing music! I enjoy the guitar, recorder, and clarinet, and exploring different music genres is one of my favorite pastimes.
